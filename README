# Birch

Birch is a simple proxy or tunnel application with a filter mechanism
for line based application protocols built on TCP. Initially it was
written to add encryption in a transparent way to the IRC protocol but
as the encryption mechanism is implemented in a modular way, it is not
restricted to just supporting encryption. Filters can be supplied via
Java's Service Provider mechanism. A CLI and a GUI are available.

It was written back in 2009 and hosted on a private server with trac in
back. The server was consumed by by a space time continuum and took the
sources with it. In 2016 the continuum collapsed and released the
sources to GitHub.
